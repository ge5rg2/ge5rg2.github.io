# Social login with Auth.js 2

Next.js version

`"next": "13.2.4”`

**Setting up the NextAuth library**

`npm install next-auth`

<br/>

### **I want to print the logged in user's information on a page**

<br/>

### **For the client component**

By `importing` a `<SessionProvider>` and wrapping it around the parent component, the child components have access to the `useSession()` function.

<br/>

```jsx
(layout.js next to page.js)

'use client'

import { SessionProvider } from "next-auth/react"

export default function Layout({ children }){
  return (
    <SessionProvider>
      {children}
    </SessionProvider>
  )
}
```

▲ If we create a `layout.js` next to some `page.js` and wrap it in `<SessionProvider>` like this.

From now on, any `client component` components that go inside of it will be able to print out the logged in user information.

```jsx
(page.js)

'use client'

import { useSession } from 'next-auth/react'
export default function Page(){
  let session  = useSession();
  if (session) {
    console.log(session)
  }
...
```

<br/>

When you use `useSession()`, it will leave the currently logged in user information in its place, so you can put it in a variable and use it.

However, it's usually better to get the user information from the `server component` and send it to the `client component`.

This is because the `useSession` function may run a beat after the `html` has been displayed.

<br/>

### **For the server component**

```jsx
import { authOptions } from "@/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js"
import { getServerSession } from "next-auth"

export default function Page(){
  let session = await getServerSession(authOptions)
  if (session) {
    console.log(session)
  }
```

<br/>

If you get `getServerSession()` and `authOptions` and use them in your component, you'll have the user information there.

You can put it in a variable like `let session` and print it out.

<br/>

**Example using server component**

```jsx
export default async function RootLayout({ children }) {
  let session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
  let name = "";
  if (session) {
    name = session.user.name;
  }
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <div className="navbar">
          <Link href="/" className="logo">
            Appleforum
          </Link>

          {session ? (
            <Link href="/write">Write</Link>
          ) : (
            <Link href="/register">Register</Link>
          )}
          <Link href="/list">List</Link>
          {session ? (
            <Link href="/">
              <LogoutBtn userName={name} />
            </Link>
          ) : (
            <LoginBtn />
          )}
        </div>
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

<br/>

<img src="/assets/img/next/7.png" width="100%"  height="100%" title="ex" alt="ex" />

The user's name appears as text before `Button`.

<br/>

### Social Login Disadvantages

However, since social login is a method that relies on a third-party site

<br/>

- If that site becomes less popular over time, it can become obscure.
- If that site goes down, like the KakaoTalk server fire, social login is impossible.

<br/>

But if you choose a reliable company like Google or Apple.

it doesn't seem to matter if you create only one social login..
